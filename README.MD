# Rowan Courses (Better Section Tally)
The goal of this repo is to create a convientent way for rowan students to view class information. I personally dispised the way rowan handled course registration. Therefore I created this repo to help myself and fellow rowan students to register for their classes.

### Benefits of using this over Section Tally:
- Shows Class Prerequisites
- Shows Profssor reviews from RateMyProfessor
- Better display of class meeting time
- Better display of class limit
- Much faster because everything is pre-downloaded
- Cleaner and modern UI (coming up)
- Dummy calendar to view how your class times fit (coming up)
